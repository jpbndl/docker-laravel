# laravel-docker-file
Host your laravel app using this dockerfile

# Overview

This setup includes two key configuration files:

1. **Dockerfile**  
   - Builds a custom PHP environment with all necessary dependencies required for the application.  
   - Includes tools, libraries, and extensions like `pdo`, `pdo_pgsql`, and Composer.

2. **docker-compose.yaml**  
   - Defines the services for the application:
     - **App Tier**: Runs the PHP-based application.
     - **DB Tier**: Configures a PostgreSQL database.
   - Specifies networking, ports, volumes, and environment variables for seamless communication between containers.

# Running the Setup

   - Follow the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform.
